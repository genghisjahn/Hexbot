Hexbot
======

Software bot that tries to cross a board of hexagons with varying heights.

Not yet finished.  

Right now you can manually move the bot(represented by a dot at the bottom the the field) across the field by clicking on adjacent hexagons.
A log of moves will populate on the right hand side of the form.
